# Coding-Exercises
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate different coding skills. Mainly focused on machine learning, computer vision and general interview prep

## 01_Machine-Learning
Here the focus is to maintain a vault of machine learning-related questions and basic models. In the repository, I will maintain uniformity in the frameworks used across the models

## 02_Computer-Vision
The computer vision part of this repository will also showcase low-level computer vision applications. The focus of this repository is to demonstrate the use of different libraries and coding styles; but at the same time, keeping it simple.

## 03_Interview-Prep :memo:
This section will basically include select tricky questions I come across during my interview preparation.
